## 🛠️ Installation & Setup (Local Development)

To get the project running on your local machine for development:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Wmugacha/alx-project-nexus.git](https://github.com/Wmugacha/alx-project-nexus.git)
    cd alx-project-nexus/ecommerce-backend
    ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file:  
    Create a file named `.env` in the `ecommerce_backend/ecommerce_project/` directory (where `settings.py` is located) and add your local environment variables.

    For local PostgreSQL, you might use something like:

    ```bash
    DEBUG=True
    SECRET_KEY=your_very_secret_key_for_local_dev
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY
    STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_STRIPE_TEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET # From Stripe Dashboard for local webhook
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Or your local frontend URL
    ```

5. Start Docker Compose services (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis):

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

    This will spin up the necessary services in Docker containers.

6. Apply database migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7. Create a superuser (for Django Admin access):

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

8. Seed the database with sample data:

    ```bash
    python manage.py seed
    ```

9. Run the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

Your API should now be running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## 🚀 Deployment (Railway)

This backend is continuously deployed to Railway.

- **Database**: Leverages a managed PostgreSQL service on Railway.
- **Containerization**: The application is deployed via Docker, with the Dockerfile handling all build steps, including static file collection.
- **Automatic Deployments**: Pushing changes to the main branch on GitHub automatically triggers a new build and deployment on Railway.
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive keys and configurations (DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, Stripe keys) are securely managed as environment variables on the Railway platform.
- **Live API Documentation**: Access the interactive Swagger UI for the deployed application at:  
  [API Documentation](https://alxprojectnexus.up.railway.app/swagger/)

## 🔑 Authentication (JWT) Workflow

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.

- **Register a User**: Use the `POST /api/users/register/` endpoint to create a new user account.
- **Obtain Access & Refresh Tokens**: Send a `POST` request to `/api/token/` (or `/api/token/pair/`) with your email and password. The response will provide an access token (short-lived) and a refresh token (longer-lived).
- **Authorize API Requests**: Include the access token in the `Authorization` header of all subsequent protected API requests:
  ```bash
  Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>
  ```

In Swagger UI, use the "Authorize" button at the top to set this header for all requests.

* **Refresh Token**: When the access token expires, use the refresh token with a `POST` request to `/api/token/refresh/` to obtain a new access token.

## 📈 Optimization Techniques Implemented

* **Database Indexing**: Strategic use of database indexes on frequently queried fields to speed up data retrieval.
* **Query Optimization**: Utilizing Django ORM's `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to minimize database queries for related objects.
* **Background Tasks**: Offloading long-running or non-critical operations to Celery, preventing API blocking and improving user experience.

## 🧪 Testing

* **API Endpoints**: Thoroughly tested using Postman for individual requests and Swagger UI for interactive exploration and automated request generation.
* **Payment Flow**: Tested end-to-end with Stripe's test card numbers and simulated payment events from the Stripe Dashboard and Stripe CLI.
* **Webhooks**: Verified robust webhook handling by simulating various Stripe events using the `stripe trigger` command and monitoring application logs on Railway.

## 🔄 Version Control & Workflow

* **Atomic Commits**: Maintaining a history of small, self-contained changes with descriptive commit messages.
* **Feature-Branch Workflow**: Development occurs on dedicated feature, fix, or performance branches (feat/, fix/, perf/ prefixes) to ensure a clean main branch.
* **Organized Codebase**: Adhering to Django conventions and clear naming for maintainability.
* **.gitignore**: Properly configured to exclude sensitive information and unnecessary files from the repository.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

* **End-to-End REST API Architecture**: Gained deep insight into designing and implementing a complete RESTful API with Django and DRF.
* **Secure Authentication & Authorization**: Mastered JWT token-based authentication and implementing permission layers.
* **Payment Workflows & Webhook Handling**: Understood the complexities of integrating a payment gateway like Stripe, including the critical role of secure webhook processing and `checkout.session.completed` events for order fulfillment.
* **Static File Serving in Production**: Emphasized the importance of Whitenoise and `collectstatic` for serving static assets in a deployed Django application.
* **Dockerized Development & Deployment**: Gained hands-on experience in containerizing a Django application and deploying it to a PaaS like Railway, including debugging common deployment issues (e.g., database migrations, environment variables, static files).
* **API Documentation Standards**: Appreciated the value of auto-generated, interactive API documentation for clarity and collaboration.
